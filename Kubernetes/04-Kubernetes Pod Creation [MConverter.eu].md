**Study Material: Creating and Managing Pods in Kubernetes**

**Introduction**

In this section, we'll learn how to create and manage **Pods** in
Kubernetes. Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and
they can contain one or more containers. We'll use the kubectl run
command to create a Pod and explore its details.

**Step 1: Create a Pod Using kubectl run**

The kubectl run command is similar to the docker run command, but it
creates a **Pod** instead of just a container. Let's create a Pod
running an Nginx web server.

**Create an Nginx Pod:**

1.  Run the following command to create a Pod named nginx using the
    nginx Docker image:

2.  kubectl run nginx \--image=nginx

    - nginx: Name of the Pod.

    - \--image=nginx: Specifies the Docker image to use (in this case,
      nginx).

3.  You'll see the output:

4.  pod/nginx created

**Verify the Pod:**

1.  List all Pods in the default namespace:

2.  kubectl get pods

You'll see the nginx Pod with a status of **ContainerCreating**
initially, and then **Running** after a few seconds.

3.  Describe the Pod to see detailed information:

4.  kubectl describe pod nginx

You'll see details like:

- **Namespace**: default

- **Node**: The node where the Pod is running.

- **IP Address**: The internal IP address assigned to the Pod.

- **Containers**: The container(s) running inside the Pod.

**Step 2: Explore the Pod Internals**

Let's explore what happens inside the Kubernetes node when a Pod is
created.

**SSH into the Minikube Node:**

1.  Get the IP address of the Minikube node:

2.  minikube ip

3.  SSH into the node:

4.  ssh docker@\<minikube-ip\>

Use the password: **tcuser**.

**List Docker Containers:**

1.  Inside the Minikube node, list all running Docker containers:

2.  docker ps

You'll see two containers related to the nginx Pod:

- **k8s_nginx_nginx_default**: The Nginx container.

- **k8s_POD_nginx_default**: The **Pause container**, which manages the
  Pod's namespaces.

**Connect to the Nginx Container:**

1.  Connect to the Nginx container:

2.  docker exec -it \<container-id\> sh

Replace \<container-id\> with the ID of the k8s_nginx_nginx_default
container.

3.  Inside the container, check the hostname and IP address:

4.  hostname

5.  ifconfig

You'll see the Pod's internal IP address.

6.  Test the Nginx web server:

7.  curl http://localhost

You'll see the default Nginx welcome page.

8.  Exit the container:

9.  exit

**Step 3: Access the Pod from Outside**

By default, Pods have internal IP addresses that are not accessible from
outside the cluster. To expose a Pod to the outside world, you need to
create a **Service**. We'll cover Services in the next section.

**Step 4: Delete the Pod**

Let's delete the nginx Pod to clean up.

**Delete the Pod:**

1.  Delete the Pod:

2.  kubectl delete pod nginx

You'll see the output:

pod \"nginx\" deleted

3.  Verify that the Pod is deleted:

4.  kubectl get pods

You'll see: **No resources found in default namespace.**

**Step 5: Create an Alias for kubectl**

Typing kubectl repeatedly can be tedious. Let's create an alias to
shorten it to k.

**Create an Alias:**

1.  For Linux/macOS users:

2.  alias k=\"kubectl\"

3.  For Windows users using Git Bash:

    - Open Git Bash.

    - Run the same command:

    - alias k=\"kubectl\"

4.  Test the alias:

5.  k get pods

You'll see the same output as kubectl get pods.

**Make the Alias Permanent (Optional):**

To make the alias permanent, add it to your shell configuration file:

- For **bash**: Add the alias to \~/.bashrc or \~/.bash_profile.

- For **zsh**: Add the alias to \~/.zshrc.

Example:

echo \'alias k=\"kubectl\"\' \>\> \~/.bashrc

source \~/.bashrc

**Key Takeaways**

- **Pods** are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.

- Use kubectl run to create a Pod.

- Pods have internal IP addresses and are not accessible from outside
  the cluster by default.

- Use kubectl describe pod to get detailed information about a Pod.

- Create an alias (k) for kubectl to save time.

**Next Steps**

Now that you've created and explored a Pod, you can:

- Create **Deployments** to manage multiple Pods.

- Expose Pods to the outside world using **Services**.

- Scale applications by increasing the number of Pods.

**Commands Summary**

| **Command**                      | **Description**                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| kubectl run nginx \--image=nginx | Create a Pod named nginx using the nginx image. |
| kubectl get pods                 | List all Pods in the default namespace.         |
| kubectl describe pod nginx       | Show detailed information about the nginx Pod.  |
| kubectl delete pod nginx         | Delete the nginx Pod.                           |
| alias k=\"kubectl\"              | Create an alias for kubectl.                    |

**Troubleshooting**

- **Pod stuck in ContainerCreating**: Check if the Docker image is being
  pulled. Use kubectl describe pod to see the logs.

- **Cannot connect to Pod**: Pods have internal IPs. Use a **Service**
  to expose them externally.

With this knowledge, you're ready to start deploying and managing
applications in Kubernetes! ðŸš€
