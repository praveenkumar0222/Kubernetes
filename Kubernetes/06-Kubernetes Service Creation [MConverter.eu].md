**Study Guide: Creating and Using Services in Kubernetes**

**Introduction**

In Kubernetes, a **Service** is an abstraction that enables network
access to applications running in Pods. Services provide a stable
endpoint for communication, ensuring that even if individual Pods are
replaced, the application remains accessible. Kubernetes offers
different types of Services, such as **ClusterIP**, **NodePort**, and
**LoadBalancer**. This guide focuses on creating a **ClusterIP**
Service, which provides internal communication within the cluster.

**Step 1: Creating a ClusterIP Service**

A **ClusterIP** Service assigns a virtual IP address, allowing
communication between Pods within the cluster.

**Expose a Deployment Using ClusterIP**

1.  Ensure you have an existing Deployment. For example, create an Nginx
    Deployment:

2.  kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment \--image=nginx

3.  Create a ClusterIP Service to expose the Deployment:

4.  kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment \--port=88
    \--target-port=80

    - \--port=88: The Service port clients will connect to.

    - \--target-port=80: The port on which the Nginx container is
      listening.

5.  Verify that the Service was created:

6.  kubectl get services

The output will display a Service named nginx-deployment with a
**ClusterIP** and an IP address like 10.96.x.x.

**Step 2: Exploring Service Details**

Understanding the Service properties helps in debugging and managing
Kubernetes networking.

**View Service Details**

1.  Describe the Service to inspect its properties:

2.  kubectl describe service nginx-deployment

This command provides information such as:

- **ClusterIP**: The virtual IP assigned to the Service.

- **Ports**: The mapped ports for communication.

- **Endpoints**: The Pods assigned to the Service.

**Step 3: Accessing the Service**

A **ClusterIP** Service is only accessible within the Kubernetes
cluster.

**Access the Service from Within the Cluster**

1.  SSH into the Minikube node (if using Minikube):

2.  minikube ssh

3.  Retrieve the ClusterIP of the Service:

4.  kubectl get services

5.  Use curl to test connectivity:

6.  curl \<cluster-ip\>:88

This should return the Nginx welcome page.

7.  Exit the SSH session:

8.  exit

**Access the Service from Outside the Cluster**

Attempting to access the ClusterIP Service from your local machine:

curl \<cluster-ip\>:88

This will fail because ClusterIP Services are not externally accessible.
To expose a Service externally, consider using **NodePort** or
**LoadBalancer** types.

**Key Takeaways**

- **ClusterIP Services** facilitate internal communication within a
  Kubernetes cluster.

- They provide a stable IP address for connecting multiple Pods.

- Use kubectl expose to create a Service for a Deployment.

- **ClusterIP Services are not accessible from outside the cluster.**
  Use **NodePort** or **LoadBalancer** for external access.

**Command Summary**

| **Command**                                                             | **Description**                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| kubectl expose deployment \<name\> \--port=\<p1\> \--target-port=\<p2\> | Creates a ClusterIP Service for a Deployment.            |
| kubectl get services                                                    | Lists all Services.                                      |
| kubectl describe service \<name\>                                       | Displays detailed information about a Service.           |
| minikube ssh                                                            | SSH into the Minikube node.                              |
| curl \<cluster-ip\>:\<port\>                                            | Tests connectivity to a Service from within the cluster. |

**Next Steps**

With a basic understanding of ClusterIP Services, you can now:

- Deploy a **NodePort** Service to expose applications externally.

- Use a **LoadBalancer** Service in cloud environments.

- Implement an **Ingress Controller** for advanced traffic routing.

This guide equips you with the fundamental knowledge to manage Services
in Kubernetes effectively. ðŸš€

\### Study Material: Creating and Using Services in Kubernetes

\-\--

\#### \*\*Introduction\*\*

In Kubernetes, a \*\*Service\*\* is an abstraction that exposes your
application (running in Pods) to the network. Services allow you to
connect to your application using a single IP address, even if it's
running across multiple Pods. There are different types of Services,
such as \*\*ClusterIP\*\*, \*\*NodePort\*\*, and \*\*LoadBalancer\*\*.
In this section, we'll focus on creating a \*\*ClusterIP\*\* Service.

\-\--

\### \*\*Step 1: Create a ClusterIP Service\*\*

A \*\*ClusterIP\*\* Service exposes your application internally within
the Kubernetes cluster. It assigns a virtual IP address that can be used
to access your application from inside the cluster.

\-\--

\#### \*\*Expose a Deployment Using ClusterIP:\*\*

1\. Ensure you have a Deployment running. For example, let's assume you
have an Nginx Deployment:

\`\`\`bash

kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment \--image=nginx

\`\`\`

2\. Expose the Deployment using a ClusterIP Service:

\`\`\`bash

kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment \--port=88 \--target-port=80

\`\`\`

\- \`\--port=88\`: The external port exposed by the Service.

\- \`\--target-port=80\`: The internal port where the application is
running (Nginx runs on port 80 by default).

3\. Verify the Service:

\`\`\`bash

kubectl get services

\`\`\`

You'll see a Service named \`nginx-deployment\` with a \*\*ClusterIP\*\*
type and an IP address like \`10.96.x.x\`.

\-\--

\### \*\*Step 2: Explore the Service Details\*\*

Let's explore the details of the Service to understand how it works.

\-\--

\#### \*\*Describe the Service:\*\*

1\. Describe the Service to see detailed information:

\`\`\`bash

kubectl describe service nginx-deployment

\`\`\`

You'll see:

\- \*\*ClusterIP\*\*: The virtual IP address assigned to the Service.

\- \*\*Port\*\*: The external port (e.g., \`88\`).

\- \*\*TargetPort\*\*: The internal port (e.g., \`80\`).

\- \*\*Endpoints\*\*: The IP addresses of the Pods managed by the
Service.

\-\--

\### \*\*Step 3: Access the Service\*\*

A \*\*ClusterIP\*\* Service is only accessible from within the
Kubernetes cluster. Let's test connectivity.

\-\--

\#### \*\*Access the Service from Inside the Cluster:\*\*

1\. SSH into the Minikube node:

\`\`\`bash

minikube ssh

\`\`\`

2\. Use \`curl\` to connect to the Service's ClusterIP and port:

\`\`\`bash

curl \<cluster-ip\>:88

\`\`\`

You'll see the Nginx welcome page.

3\. Exit the SSH session:

\`\`\`bash

exit

\`\`\`

\-\--

\#### \*\*Access the Service from Outside the Cluster:\*\*

1\. Try accessing the Service from your local machine:

\`\`\`bash

curl \<cluster-ip\>:88

\`\`\`

You'll see \*\*no response\*\* because ClusterIP Services are not
accessible from outside the cluster.

\-\--

\### \*\*Step 4: Key Takeaways\*\*

\- \*\*ClusterIP\*\* Services expose your application internally within
the Kubernetes cluster.

\- They provide a single virtual IP address to access multiple Pods.

\- Use \`kubectl expose\` to create a Service for a Deployment.

\- ClusterIP Services are not accessible from outside the cluster. For
external access, use \*\*NodePort\*\* or \*\*LoadBalancer\*\* Services.

externally.

\- Use a \*\*LoadBalancer\*\* Service for cloud environments.

\- Explore advanced Service configurations like \*\*Ingress\*\*.

in Kubernetes! ðŸš€
