**Study Material: Introduction to Kubernetes for Beginners**

**What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **k8s**) is a **container orchestration
system**. It helps you manage and run containerized applications across
multiple servers (physical or virtual) automatically. Think of it as a
\"manager\" for your containers, ensuring they run smoothly, scale when
needed, and recover from failures without manual intervention.

**Why Do We Need Kubernetes?**

Imagine you have a containerized application (e.g., a website or an app)
running on Docker. If you want to run multiple containers across
different servers, managing them manually can be a nightmare. Kubernetes
solves this problem by:

1.  **Automating deployment**: Deploys containers across multiple
    servers.

2.  **Scaling**: Increases or decreases the number of containers based
    on demand.

3.  **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly across containers.

4.  **Self-healing**: Replaces failed containers automatically.

**Key Concepts in Kubernetes**

Let's break down the key terms and concepts in Kubernetes to make it
easier to understand.

**1. Containers and Pods**

-   **Container**: A lightweight, standalone package that includes
    everything needed to run a piece of software (e.g., code, libraries,
    dependencies). Docker is a popular tool for creating containers.

-   **Pod**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or
    more containers that share resources like storage and network. For
    example:

    -   A pod can have a single container running a web server.

    -   Or, it can have multiple containers working together (e.g., one
        for the app and another for logging).

**Example**:

Pod (Web Application)

â”œâ”€â”€ Container 1: Web Server

â””â”€â”€ Container 2: Logging Service

**2. Nodes and Clusters**

-   **Node**: A server (physical or virtual) that runs your pods. Nodes
    are the \"workers\" in a Kubernetes cluster.

-   **Cluster**: A group of nodes working together. A cluster has:

    -   **Master Node**: Manages the cluster (e.g., schedules workloads,
        monitors health).

    -   **Worker Nodes**: Run the actual applications (pods).

**Diagram**:

â””â”€â”€ Worker Nodes (Workers)

â”œâ”€â”€ Node 1

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Pod 1

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Pod 2

â””â”€â”€ Node 2

â”œâ”€â”€ Pod 3

â””â”€â”€ Pod 4

**3. Key Terms in Kubernetes**

-   **Container**: The smallest unit in Docker. Runs applications in
    isolated environments.

-   **Pod**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or
    more containers.

**Pod Anatomy**

-   Contains containers (usually one, but can have multiple).

-   Shares volumes (storage) and network resources (like IP addresses)
    among containers.

-   All containers in a pod run on the same server.

-   Example: A pod with a web server container and a logging container
    sharing the same IP address.

**4. Kubernetes Cluster**

-   **Cluster**: A group of servers (nodes) working together to run
    applications.

-   **Nodes**: Servers (physical or virtual) in the cluster.

-   **Master Node**: Manages the cluster. Runs system services but not
    client applications.

-   **Worker Nodes**: Run the actual application pods.

-   **Example**: A cluster with 1 master node and 3 worker nodes.

**5. Services in Kubernetes**

-   **Container Runtime**: Runs containers on each node (e.g., Docker,
    CRI-O, Containerd).

-   **kubelet**: Communicates with the master node to manage pods.

-   **kube-proxy**: Handles network communication between nodes.

-   **API Server**: The main communication point for the cluster. Used
    to manage the cluster.

-   **Scheduler**: Distributes workloads across nodes.

-   **Controller Manager**: Manages the state of the cluster.

-   **etcd**: Stores logs and configuration data as key-value pairs.

-   **DNS Service**: Resolves names within the cluster.

**6. How Kubernetes Works**

1.  **Automated Deployment**: You tell Kubernetes how many containers to
    run, and it handles the rest.

2.  **Scaling**: Automatically increases or decreases the number of
    containers based on demand.

3.  **Self-Healing**: Replaces failed containers without manual
    intervention.

4.  **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly across containers.

**7. Kubernetes Shortcut: k8s**

-   **Why k8s?**: Kubernetes has 10 letters. The \"8\" represents the 8
    letters between \"K\" and \"s\".

-   **Example**: \"Kubernetes\" â†’ \"k8s\".

**8. Managing Kubernetes**

-   **kubectl**: A command-line tool to manage Kubernetes clusters.

    -   **Example**: Use kubectl to create, update, or delete pods and
        services.

-   **API Server**: All management commands are sent to the API server
    on the master node.

\### 3. \*\*Services in Kubernetes\*\*

Kubernetes uses several services to manage the cluster:

\- \*\*API Server\*\*: The \"brain\" of the cluster. It handles
communication between the master node and worker nodes.

\- \*\*kubelet\*\*: Runs on each node and ensures containers are running
in pods.

\- \*\*kube-proxy\*\*: Manages network communication between pods and
nodes.

\- \*\*Container Runtime\*\*: Software like Docker or CRI-O that runs
containers inside pods.

\-\--

\### 4. \*\*How Kubernetes Works\*\*

1\. You tell Kubernetes what you want (e.g., \"Run 5 containers of my
app\").

2\. Kubernetes automatically:

\- Deploys the containers across nodes.

\- Balances the load.

\- Monitors the health of containers.

\- Replaces failed containers.

\*\*Example\*\*:

\- You want to run a web app with 3 containers.

\- Kubernetes deploys 1 container on Node 1, 1 on Node 2, and 1 on Node
3.

\- If one container fails, Kubernetes replaces it automatically.

\-\--

\### 5. \*\*Kubernetes Shortcut: k8s\*\*

\- The word \"Kubernetes\" is long, so developers shorten it to
\*\*k8s\*\*.

\- The \"8\" represents the 8 letters between \"K\" and \"s\" in
\"Kubernetes.\"

\-\--

\### 6. \*\*Kubernetes Without Docker\*\*

While Docker is a popular container runtime, Kubernetes can also use
other runtimes like:

\- \*\*CRI-O\*\*

\- \*\*containerd\*\*

This means Kubernetes is flexible and not tied to Docker.

\-\--

\### 7. \*\*Practical Use Cases\*\*

Here's what you can do with Kubernetes:

\- \*\*Deploy applications\*\*: Run your app across multiple servers.

\- \*\*Scale applications\*\*: Increase or decrease the number of
containers based on traffic.

\- \*\*Load balancing\*\*: Distribute traffic evenly.

\- \*\*Self-healing\*\*: Automatically replace failed containers.
